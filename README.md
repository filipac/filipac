### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻 My name is Filip Pacurar, web developer for over 10 years.
📆 I started my first programming job in 2012, but I knew PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS long before this.

👷‍♂️ At 12 years old I forked a torrent tracker PHP script to make it suit my needs, in fact it is still around here on Github and on Sourceforge.

🚧 I currently work daily with these technologies:

- PHP
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- CSS [TailwindCSS]
- A lot of JavaScript - React, Vue.JS, AureliaJS, AdonisJS.. a lot of frameworks and vanilla JS
- Some Python and Ruby for hobby projects
- Bash
- VILT stack
- A lot of Laravel

🛑 I am going to stop now because I tend to use whatever is necesary, not limiting myself to a single technology.

🕸️ You can [read more about me and my work on my blog](https://pacurar.dev).

BTW, my website is very weird and I also have hidden things and easter eggs.

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. That would be all for now.

👋
